# X32 Disco

Run pretty rainbows and wavy faders on your X32/M32. Not a serious project.

It attempts to restore the original channel colors after stopping the script. This may not always work.
Also it messes with the fader values. **Do not try this during a show.**

Usage: `main.py --address 192.168.0.100`
Enjoy rainbows until `Ctrl+C`.
